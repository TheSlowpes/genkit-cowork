# genkit-cowork

A coworking framework for [Firebase Genkit](https://github.com/firebase/genkit) (Go) that gives AI agents pluggable capabilities for autonomous and interactive work. The framework is built around four pillars — **Flows**, **Tools**, **Memory**, and **Skills** — each of which can be registered with a Genkit application independently or as a complete suite.

```

### 1. Flows

Flows define how agents execute work. The current implementation in `genkit-cowork/flows` includes:

**Agent Loop (`agentLoop`)** — A model-driven turn loop that generates model responses, executes tool requests, appends tool responses, and continues until no more tool requests are returned. Supports max-turn limits, tool interrupt handling, and resume inputs (`toolResponses`, `toolRestarts`).

**Message Flow (`handleMessage`)** — Session-backed chat-style flow that loads or creates session state, appends incoming message content, runs the agent loop, and persists newly generated messages.

**Heartbeat Flow (`heartbeat`)** — Periodic/background flow that runs the agent loop against current session state and classifies results as `ack`, `alert`, `skipped`, or `error` based on heartbeat response parsing.

**Flow Events (`EventBus`)** — Typed event lifecycle with synchronous subscribers for `agent`, `turn`, `message`, and `tool-execution` stages. `tool-execution-start` handlers can mutate tool input before execution.

### 2. Tools

Tools define what agents can do. Each tool is registered with a Genkit instance and follows the functional options pattern for configuration and the operator/strategy interface pattern for testability and sandboxing.

**Bash** — Execute shell commands with configurable timeout, working directory, environment, and spawn hooks. Custom operators can be injected to sandbox or mock execution. See `tools/bash.go`.

**Read** — Read file contents (text and images) with line-offset pagination and output truncation. Supports image MIME detection and auto-resizing. See `tools/read.go`.

**Edit** — Find-and-replace editing with exact and fuzzy text matching, uniqueness validation, and unified diff output. See `tools/edit.go`.

**Write** — Create or overwrite files with automatic parent directory creation. Custom operators can be injected for sandboxing or testing. See `tools/write.go`.

Tools are created via constructor functions that return `ai.Tool`, which integrates directly with the Genkit tool system:

```go
bashTool := tools.NewBashTool(g, cwd, tools.WithCommandPrefix("..."))
readTool := tools.NewReadTool(g, cwd, tools.WithCustomReadOperator(op))
editTool := tools.NewEditTool(g, cwd)
writeTool := tools.NewWriteTool(g, cwd)
```

### 3. Memory

Memory defines what agents remember across and within sessions. The memory system uses a combination of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for semantic search and markdown files for human-readable, editable state.

**Sessions** — Markdown-based persistence of conversation and session state. Sessions capture the interaction history and working context so an agent can resume where it left off or hand off to another agent.

**Retrieval** — RAG-powered search over knowledge bases and accumulated context. Retrieval enables agents to find relevant information from large bodies of prior work, documentation, or domain knowledge using vector similarity.

**Recall** — Structured markdown files that store key decisions, facts, patterns, and lessons learned. Recall provides a persistent, inspectable record that agents can reference for consistency and that humans can review and edit directly.

The combination of RAG and markdown ensures that memory is both semantically searchable by agents and transparently readable by humans.

### 4. Skills

Skills define what agents know. The skill system is implemented as a Genkit plugin (`plugins/skills/`) that discovers, parses, and serves domain-specific knowledge from `SKILL.md` files.

**Plugin Registration** — The `Skills` struct implements `api.Plugin` and is registered via `genkit.WithPlugins()`. On `Init`, it scans the configured `SkillsDir` (default `./skills`) for subdirectories containing `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, optional `license` and `metadata`).

**Discovery** — `discoverSkills` walks top-level subdirectories, parses each `SKILL.md` via `parseSkillMetadata`, validates required fields, and catalogs all files in the skill directory (including one level of subdirectories). Invalid skills are silently skipped.

**Tools** — The plugin provides two tools:
- `ListSkillsTool(g)` — Returns discovered skills with optional name substring filter. Tool name: `list-skills`.
- `ResolveSkillTool(g)` — Loads the full Markdown body and metadata for a named skill. Body content is loaded lazily (not during Init). Tool name: `resolve-skill`.

Skills are loaded and composed alongside the other pillars, allowing an agent to be configured with exactly the competencies required for its role.

## Pluggability

The framework is designed so that each pillar can be registered with a Genkit application independently. A consumer can adopt the full framework or pick individual pieces:

**Full framework** — Register all four pillars to get a fully capable coworking agent.

**Individual tools** — Register only the tools you need. Each tool constructor (`NewBashTool`, `NewReadTool`, etc.) returns a standalone `ai.Tool` that works with any Genkit instance.

**Individual pillars** — Mix and match flows, tools, memory, and skills based on the use case. An application might use only the tools and memory pillars without flows or skills, or use chat flows with a custom tool set.

All constructors accept functional options for configuration and operator/strategy interfaces for swapping implementations, making each component independently testable and customizable.

### Design Patterns

**Functional Options** — All tool constructors accept variadic option functions (`BashToolOption`, `ReadToolOption`) that mutate a private options struct. This keeps the API clean while allowing extensive configuration.

**Operator Interfaces** — `BashOperator`, `ReadOperator`, `EditOperator`, and `WriteOperator` abstract the actual I/O operations behind interfaces. Default implementations are provided, but consumers can inject custom operators for sandboxing, testing, or alternative execution environments. All operator methods that perform I/O accept `context.Context` for cooperative cancellation.

**Hook System** — Hooks (e.g., `BashSpawnHook`) allow callers to intercept and modify execution context before an operation runs. This pattern will extend to flows and other pillars.

## Development

### Conventions

- Go module path: `github.com/TheSlowpes/genkit-cowork`
- Primary dependency: `github.com/firebase/genkit/go v1.4.0`
- Use functional options for all public constructors
- Define operator interfaces for any I/O or side-effecting operations
- Keep tool handler logic in the `tools` package; supporting utilities in `media` and `utils`
- All operator interface methods that perform I/O accept `context.Context` as their first parameter for cooperative cancellation
- `main.go` is gitignored and used for local testing only
